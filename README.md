Simple Python Calculator

Hi there!  
This is a beginner-friendly **Python calculator** I built using **Pydroid 3** on my Android phone.

It supports basic math operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (−)
- Multiplication (×)
- Division (÷)
- Percentage (%) — like “What is 25% of 200?”

The calculator runs in a loop, so you can keep using it until you type `exit`.


## Example

Enter first number: 25 Enter operator (+, -, *, /, %): % Enter second number: 200 Result: 50.0

## Why I Made This

I’m currently learning Python and wanted to build something practical and useful.  
This project helped me understand:
- How user input works
- How to use conditionals and loops
- How to handle simple errors (like dividing by zero)
- How to upload code to GitHub from a phone

## How to Run It

1. Save the code as `calculator.py`
2. Run it using any Python environment (I used Pydroid 3 on Android)
3. Follow the prompts and do your calculations!

## What's Next?

I plan to:
- Add a history feature
- Add option to save calculations in a file

Thanks for checking out my project!
